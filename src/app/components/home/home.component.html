  <h3>Thank You</h3>
  <p class="long-info">The Foxtrot Fanatics have finally achieved all of its primary goals that it initially set out to do back in 2017. Over the years we've made friends, learned things, and made some kick-ass software and subtitles free and open to everyone and anyone. We'd like to take this time to thank everyone that contributed over the years, whether it be transcription, or beta testing the upscaler, or even just a $1 donation to help keep the lights on, we really appreciate it. For now, it's curtains for The Foxtrot Fanatics but if we ever get an inkling to come back and do something bigger and better, we'll be sure to announce it on our twitter: <a class="inline-link" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/foxtrotfanatics">@foxtrotfanatics</a>.

  Till then,<br>

      We're a small team of passionate Code Lyoko fans that embarked on a two-year journey to preserve Code Lyoko in the best quality possible. With the utilization of deep-learning algorithms and cold hard sweat, we brought the finest premium USDA-approved viewing experience for Code Lyoko you would ever lay eyes on. This came with all the fixings: 1440p upscaled Code Lyoko, English subtitles, multiple audio tracks, as well as a few bonus features previously thought to be lost media.</p>

      This journey initially started with Christian Deville <i>(Christian77777)</i> in late March of 2017, who was, at the time, trying to improve his home media collection. This quickly snowballed into a group effort when Christian set gaze upon this beloved childhood show and garnered help from the local <a id="r-button" class="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CodeLyoko" target="_blank">CL Fan Subreddit</a>. With help from the community,they set out to make a full set of subtitles for the English dub of CL to compliment his home media. This, of course, turned into an effort to also give these subtitles away to those wanting them, such that, those with hearing impairments wanting to enjoy the show or those wanting to enjoy the French dub with English subs could do so. From this, a humble but determined group of subtitlers and programmers gathered, and from the commotion and clatter, the Foxtrot Fanatics was formed, only rivaled by the notorious amateur French band from Kadic: the Pop-Rock Progressives.
